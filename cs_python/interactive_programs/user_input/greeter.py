# Python 2.7

# The input() function, or raw_input() takes one argument: the prompt
# or instructions, that we want to display to the user so they know what to do.

# IMPORTNANT: WRITE CLEAR PROMPTS!
# Each time you use the input() function, you should include a clear, easy-to-follow
# prompt that tells the user exactly what kind of inforamtion you're looking for.

# Write a program that asks for the user's name, then have the
# exact name they typed in return to the user.
