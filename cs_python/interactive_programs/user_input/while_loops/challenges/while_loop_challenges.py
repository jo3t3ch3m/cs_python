# Pizza Toppings:
# Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings
# until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message
# saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.

# Movie Tickets:
# Let's say a zoo charges different ticket prices depending on
# a person's age. If a person is under the age of 5, the ticket is free;
# if they are between 5 and 12, the ticket is $10;
# and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15.
# Write a loop where you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
# of the zoo ticket.
