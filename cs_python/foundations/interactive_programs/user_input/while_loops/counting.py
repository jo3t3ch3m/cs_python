# Python 2.7

# Recall for loops
# The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once
# for each item in the collection.
# In contrast, the while loop runs as longs as (or while) a certain condition is true

# For example, you can use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers.
# Let's say, we need a while loop that counts from 1 to 5:

current_number = 1 # we start counting from 1
while current_number <= 5: 
    print(current_number) 
    current_number += 1

# This loop is set to keep running as long as the value of current_number is
# less than or equal to 5.
# The code inside the loop prints the value of current_number and
# then adds 1 to that value with current_number += 1.

# (The += operator is shorthand for current_number = current_number + 1.)

# Python runs the loop as long as the condition ccurrent_number<= 5 is true.
# Because 1 is less than 5, Python prints 1 and then adds 1,
# making the current number 2, and so on.

# The loop stops when the value of current_number is greater than 5 and our program ends.

# While loops are used widely!
# The programs you use every day most likely contain while loops.

# For example, a game needs a while loop to keep running as long as you
# want to keep playing, so it can stop running when you want to quit.

# While loops are super useful!
