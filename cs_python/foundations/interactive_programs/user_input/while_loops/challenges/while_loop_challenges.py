# Pizza Toppings:
# Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings
# until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message
# saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.

# Movie Tickets:
# Let's say a zoo charges different ticket prices depending on
# a person's age. If a person is under the age of 5, the ticket is free;
# if they are between 5 and 12, the ticket is $10;
# and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15.
# Write a loop where you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
# of the zoo ticket.

# Practicing the Three Exits
# We've learned three techniques to end a loop:
# 1) conditional test to stop the loop
# 2) use an active variable to control how long the loop runs
# 3) use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a value (like 'quit')

# The challenge is to write three programs for each technique.

# Neverending Loop:
# Write a loop that never ends, and run it!
# Remember to press CTRL C to exit.
