# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

# One of the most effective approaches to writing software.

# Object oriented programming is amazing at modeling real-world situations

# In Object-oriented programming, you write classes that represent real-world
# things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes.
# In other words...
# Objects are defined by Classes

# When you you write a class, you define the general behavior that
# a whole category of objects can have.

# So, when you create individual objects from the class, each object is
# automatically equipped with he general behavior; you can then give each
# object whatever unique traits you desire.

# When we make an object from a class, it is called INSTANTIATION,
# and we work with instances of a class.

# Objectives:
# We'll learn how to write classes and create instances of those classes.
# We'll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances,
# and we'll define actions that can be taken with these isntances.

# We'll write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes,
# so similar classes can share code efficiently.

# Our classes we make, will be stored in modules and we'll import classes that
# have been written by other programmers in our own program files.

# Once we've dived in object-oriented programming, we'll really understand
# the code we write, not only will we understand what's happening line by line,
# but also the bigger concepts behind them.

# Object-oriented programming will train us to think logically so we will be able
# to effectively approach almost any problem.

# CREATING AND USING A CLASS

# You can model almost anything using classes. Let's start by writing a simple
# class, Dog, that represents a dog --not one dog in particular, but any dog.
# What do we know about most pet dogs?
# They have a name and age.
# and many dogs can sit and roll over.
# The two pieces of information (name and age)
# and the two behaviors (sit and roll over) can go in the class Dog,
# because they are common to most dogs.
