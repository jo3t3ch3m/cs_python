# Python 2.7

# This is a program to simulate a dichotomous key
# This specific key will aim to help identify macroinvertebrates
# caught in a particular water system

# Initial functionality notes:
# Once username verified, you can input info describing what you see
# (i.e. 6legs, thorax, protruded)
# The program will match the criteria for the possible identified bug.

# Refined notes:
# The program will directly simulate the method of identifying a collected item
# from a stream or river by walking through a dichotomous key.
# a dichotomous key is a tool used to identify something in the natural world.
# We can think of it as a decision model. In our case,
# a dichotomous key can be used by an Entomologist to identify something
# they collected from a stream.
